The **Digital Forensics Research Conference** (**DFRWS**) is a 
non-profit, volunteer organization that started in August 2001 
to bring together researchers, developers, and practitioners 
from around the world to address emerging challenges in Digital 
Forensics. The result of this inaugural event was the technical 
report “A Road Map for Digital Forensic Research” that is 
frequently referenced as a foundational framework for the domain.

The DFRWS addresses three major objectives:

* Define the need and create the processes for the incorporation of a
  rigorous scientific method as a fundamental part of the evolving
  discipline of Digital Forensics.
* Advance Digital Forensics research and development that considers 
  practitioner requirements, multiple investigative environments, and 
  emphasizes real world usability.
* The discovery, explanation and presentation of reliable, persuasive
  digital evidence that will meet the heightened scrutiny of the courts 
  and other decision-makers in civilian and military contexts.

## International Community
Since 2001, an annual workshop has been held in various cities around
North America, and the Jubilee 25th DFRWS conference will be held in 
Chicago. To meet the needs of the growing international Digital Forensics 
community, in 2014 the DFRWS started holding annual conferences in Europe,
and in 2021 started holding annual conferences in APAC.

All papers are peer reviewed and published open access with presentation 
materials in the DFRWS Papers & Presentations online catalog. Video 
recordings of selected presentations are periodically posted on the 
DFRWS YouTube channel.

## Applied Research
In 2019, the DFRWS created DFIR Review to provide practitioners with a
venue for community-reviewed applied research and testing in Digital 
Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR). Articles from DFIR Review have 
been cited in multiple court proceedings.

## DFRWS Supported Initiatives
DFRWS provides infrastructure sponsorship in collaboration with the 
Linux Foundation for the Cyber Domain Ontology (CDO) community project. 
One focus of the CDO project is Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard 
Expression (CASE) which was formally launched at DFRWS EU 2015 and 
presented as “Leveraging CybOX to Standardize Representation and 
Exchange of Digital Forensic Information.”

Another DFRWS supported project called Systematic Objective-based 
Listing of Various Established [Digital] Investigation Techniques 
(SOLVE-IT) to establish a resource and tools for systematic error 
mitigation for digital evidence. This initiative was started by the 
community at DFRWS US 2023, and formally launched at DFRWS EU 2025 
and presented as “SOLVE-IT: A proposed digital forensic knowledge 
base inspired by MITRE ATT&CK.”

## Support and Sponsorship

Sponsors of the conference gain visibility for their companies,
demonstrate their support of forensic research and development, and
contribute to the success of the conference. All sponsors will have
their logo listed on the DFRWS website with a link to their website
and will be listed in the printed proceedings. They will also get
recognition at specific events that they sponsor.

DFRWS is also supported and extended by Satellite Sites hosted by an 
institution that plans an event which incorporates a portion of the 
conference stream, allowing a group to participate in the conference 
in their region. These Satellite Sites increase opportunities for 
members of the growing community to meet and exchange knowledge.

## DFRWS Forensic Challenges

Since 2005, DFRWS has put forth challenge scenarios with associated 
data created by volunteer conference organizers to advance research 
and development  in emerging areas of Digital Forensics. These 
challenges have spawned new specializations and capabilities, 
including Windows Memory Forensics, Linux Memory Forensics, File 
Carving, Mobile Device Forensics, Malware Forensics, and IoT Forensics. 
Anyone can submit their analysis and tools that they created for a DFRWS 
Forensic Challenge. Winners are chosen by a committee and prizes include 
free registration for the DFRWS conference that year and grand prizes
for exceptional contributions to the field.
